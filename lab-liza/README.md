In your README.md describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each paramiter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalued use). Feel free to write any additional information in your README.md. <-- to be done later.
