750ml bottle poured into an El Catador club snifter. Bottling date of 11/13/15 etched on the side of the bottle. The brandy barrels dominate the nose along with caramel, raisins, plums, and brown sugar. The taste like the aroma features a lingering sweetness starting up front and lasting well into the warming finish. There is just a touch of tartness in the taste as well with a lot of booze in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, Lorem Ipsum is a solid barelywine that I think could benefit from aging. This bottle is 1.75 years old, but I do think it could use a few more years to mellow out a little in the taste.
